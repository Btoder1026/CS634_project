# Interpretable Gradient Boosting - Real Estate House Price Prediction

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won’t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition’s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

# Milestone 3: (Week 4, 30 points)
Merge the earlier branch into the main branch and create a new branch titled ‘milestone-3. Do not delete the milestone-2 branch.

Repeat the analysis in Milestone 2 but this time use this or this guide to tune with Optuna the hyperparameters of the LightGBM model.

You need to creating a streamlit app for the house price prediction problem. Streamlit is a python library that allows you to create web apps with minimal coding and deploy them in the cloud. Deploy the streamlit app in HuggingFace streamlit spaces after you create a free account. The app must resemble this UI (please avoid the shown gif image) and in addition it must show a SHAP summary plot and a SHAP interaction plot.

Submit the github repository URL with a branch titled ‘milestone-3’ with the README.md file containing the link to the deployed HF space where the Milestone 2 calculation and the optimized app calculation price prediction can both be seen.
